# Number-AI
A simple AI that can continue a sequence of numbers.

This code uses artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense of a simple form of machine learning. Using linear regression to predict the next number in the sequence of numbers is a rudimentary example of machine learning, which is a type of artificial intelligence.

Linear regression is a basic statistical technique used to estimate relationships between variables. In this case, it is used to model the relationship between the existing numbers in the sequence of numbers and make a prediction for the next number.

Generally speaking, machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows algorithms to learn from experience or data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression is just one simple form of machine learning, but there are many other more complex algorithms and techniques used in artificial intelligence to tackle more complex tasks, such as image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles and more.
